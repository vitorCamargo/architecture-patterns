### Kanui

I don't know if it because the deploy are very bad made and I can see the complete structure, but Kanui deserves congratulations for their project structure, it is very well defined, and plus, they use MVVM Pattern.
- They have a very bad way to deploy, it is visible the Model/ViewModel part of the application. But is also a good thing, even of the logic part is visible, we cannot see the way the page are made;
- They have a page for widget, which is very impressive;
- They componentize the errors, helpers and create their own way to use the Provider/Context/Cosumer paradigm. (using managers, helpers and contexts);
