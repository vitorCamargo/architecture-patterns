### Saraiva

Saraiva is Vue, man, that's amazing, I don't see a lot of web applications with VueJS, and probably their deploy are very good, it was very difficult to get these files, and those are just useful functions and knowing the lifetime of a Vue application, there are instantiated on page load, so, it does not matter if the code are minified or not. That's good.
- The files has docs (which is very good);
- They use a folder to put all the svg files, all are exported to be used;
