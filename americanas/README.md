### Americanas

Ok, this one is very good, I really don't know what language they use, but the way they render the page is very unique. The layout structure doesn't follow a pattern, but, they have services and utils folders to make control of the application, cache, memory, etc..
- Not minified;
- Layout of application has footer, header and content, the content are load by embed areas, all the components are embed in the application after the layout had loaded, it is very interesting;
- The classes are orientaded by events;
